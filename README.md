# Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predicting admission outcomes using machine learning models based on historical admission data.

## Overview

This project aims to predict admission probabilities for prospective students by analyzing historical admission data. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms, it identifies key patterns and features crucial for admission prediction.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing and understanding the dataset to identify trends and patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) for predictive modeling.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance using relevant evaluation metrics.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface allowing users to input their details and predict admission likelihood.

2. **Running the Project:**
   - Execute the main script:
     ```bash
     admission prediction using ml.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to input candidate details and view predicted admission probabilities.

3. **Contributing:**
   - Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, create pull requests, or open issues.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporating additional features or datasets for improved predictions.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
